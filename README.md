# Nibble 🐾
_A digital pet that grows as you code_


Nibble is a lightweight, offline digital pet built in Python.
It evolves through life stages based on your coding activity, rewarding consistency and progress instead of idle grinding.

## Overview

Nibble is a virtual desktop pet designed for developers.

Instead of growing through idle time, Nibble evolves based on coding activity and sessions.
The idea is simple: show up, work, improve and your pet grows with you.

Nibble lives quietly in your system tray and pops up when you want to check in.
